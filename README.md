## Authorization Statement (for Standardization Use)

This model may be adopted by standardization organizations without any licensing fee, provided that its definitions and structures are not modified in a way that conflicts with the scope of the underlying patent.

If any modifications to the model's definitions, terminology, or structural logic are proposed during the standardization process, prior consultation with the inventor is required to ensure compatibility with the protected intellectual property.

Use within standardization frameworks is therefore permitted on a royalty-free basis, under fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) conditions, as long as the original definitions are preserved or changes are pre-agreed.

## Project Status

The Semantic Chain Security Model (SCSM) is a globally patented security investigation framework independently created and structurally governed by its original inventor.

This project is not bound to, nor officially adopted by, any nation-state, governmental institution, or alliance body as of the date of June 19th.

This white paper is provided for reference only. Any form of use without prior authorization is strictly prohibited. Public citation is permitted only with proper attribution to the original source. Any technical adoption, integration, or application based on this content is only lawful with prior written authorization from the patent holder.

All conceptual content — including any similar concepts, methods, or systems falling within the scope of protection — is covered under active patent examination. Such content may not be quoted, referenced, replicated, or integrated into other systems, frameworks, or proposals except with explicit written authorization from the patent holder, in which case standardization is permitted.

Open-source authors may contact the patent holder for collaboration on non-commercial development and usage.

---

## Legal Status

The conceptual framework, architecture, and core mechanisms of SCSM are currently under active patent protection in both China (CNIPA) and the United States (USPTO), and filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).

No component, structural principle, or methodological sequence of this project may be cited, adopted, restructured, or rebranded without explicit written authorization from the structural controller.

Unauthorized derivative works—especially those attempting internal "reconstruction" under different labels—will be treated as intentional structural appropriation and may be pursued under international intellectual property frameworks.

## Reconstruction Warning

Any attempt to duplicate, reverse-engineer, reinterpret, or repackage the semantic investigation chain using altered terminology, alternative database formats, or surrogate structural labels still constitutes a direct violation of the protected architecture.

> The protection extends beyond specific terms to the entire architectural reasoning chain, including but not limited to:

- Behavior Chain Construction Logic
- Cross-IP Mapping Mechanisms
- Semantic Fragmentation & Similarity Comparison
- AI Knowledge Loop Structures
