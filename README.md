🛡️ SOVEREIGNTY & CONTROL NOTICE

Semantic Chain Security Model (SCSM)
Version: August 2025


---

🔒 Project Status: Not Under Any National Control

The Semantic Chain Security Model (SCSM) is a globally patented security investigation framework independently created and structurally governed by its original inventor.
This project is not bound to, nor officially adopted by, any nation-state, governmental institution, or alliance body as of the date of this notice.


---

📜 Legal Status

The conceptual framework, architecture, and core mechanisms of SCSM are currently under active patent protection in both China (CNIPA) and the United States (USPTO), and filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).

No component, structural principle, or methodological sequence of this project may be cited, adopted, restructured, or rebranded without explicit written authorization from the structural controller.

Unauthorized derivative works—especially those attempting internal “reconstruction” under different labels—will be treated as intentional structural appropriation and may be pursued under international intellectual property frameworks.



---

⚠️ Reconstruction Warning

Any attempt to duplicate, reverse-engineer, reinterpret, or repackage the semantic investigation chain using altered terminology, alternative database formats, or surrogate structural labels still constitutes a direct violation of the protected architecture.

> The protection extends beyond specific terms to the entire architectural reasoning chain, including but not limited to:

Behavior Chain Construction Logic

Cross-IP Mapping Mechanisms

Semantic Fragmentation & Similarity Comparison

AI Knowledge Loop Structures

✅ Cooperation Pathways Open

With the conclusion of an exclusive evaluation window (June 21 – August 8, 2025), the SCSM project has now entered an international public evaluation phase.
National agencies, standardization bodies, and strategic partners are invited to engage directly via formal structural engagement proposals or Letters of Intent (LOI).
