# SCSM Q&A

## ❓ What is the essence of SCSM? Is it a bound product? Who controls the data sovereignty?

**Answer:**  
SCSM (Semantic Chain Security Model) is not a product. It is a **structural methodology** designed to address critical bottlenecks in modern cybersecurity investigations.

Its core value lies in:  
- Defining a **semantic-driven architecture** for next-generation security investigation ("Investigation Layer")
- Supporting modular, structured, and interoperable SOC platforms
- Providing a universal certification standard **without vendor, platform, or cloud dependency**

**Deployment Flexibility:**  
- Fully **open-source compatible**
- Can be **locally developed** by any country or organization
- **Data remains fully local**, and sovereignty stays with the deployer
- **AI Model & Micro-models are pluggable and interoperable.**  
  Organizations may either independently train their own AI Model & micro-models and integrate them into certified SOC platforms, or optionally adopt pre-trained models provided by the AI-SIA Alliance.

## ❓ Do you use the “knowledge write-back” mechanism to extract internal intelligence?

**Answer:**  
No. The "Knowledge Write-Back Mechanism" is part of AI-SIA Alliance governance. It operates **under structural controller authorization** and is available only to certified governments, enterprises, and organizations.

**Key Features:**  
- **Membership in the AI-SIA Alliance is a prerequisite for certified use of the SCSM structure, as the structure is protected by system and method patents.**  
  When a government or organization adopts an SCSM-compliant platform (product-level or system-level), and generates structured security investigation reports, it is — by definition — applying the patented system and method.  

  Therefore, obtaining **organizational-level certification** serves two key purposes:  
  - It **grants legal authorization** to use the SCSM structural method within certified implementations.  
  - It **formally confirms the organization’s capability** to conduct standardized, structured security investigations in accordance with the framework.  

  **Membership in the AI-SIA Alliance does not imply an obligation to contribute data or participate in knowledge sharing.**  
  Mechanisms such as **knowledge write-back** and **micro-model collaboration** are **fully optional**, and governed by local policy and expert discretion.  

  The alliance governance model ensures full **respect for data sovereignty**, **local autonomy**, and **non-intrusive certification boundaries**.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Managed by regional representatives worldwide
- **Expert-Driven**: Write-back actions are conducted by **human experts**, not AI, and there’s **no obligation**
- **Data Anonymization Required**: Only anonymized semantic knowledge can be written back—no raw or sensitive data involved
- **No intelligence value in raw form**: Only behavior patterns, not sensitive data, are shareable

This is not a surveillance system; it is a **global cooperative knowledge model**.

## ❓ Once deployed, can we still make autonomous decisions? Is there a forced platform?

**Answer:**  
Absolutely.

SCSM only certifies the **structure**, not the product. Certification verifies whether the system meets the structural standards for semantic investigation. It **does not mandate specific vendors**.

- You may **use third-party platforms or self-develop**
- **Deployment is fully under your control**
- You may switch platforms; only **structure re-certification** is required
- **No additional license fees** during the valid authorization period

Think of SCSM as a **framework standard**, not a binding product.

## ✅ Summary: What kind of system is SCSM + AI-SIA Alliance?

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ Platform Dependency | **None** – fully decoupled |
| ✅ Deployment | **Local**, **open-source**, **self-deployable** |
| ✅ Platform Lock-In | **No** – changeable anytime |
| ✅ Data Sovereignty | **Fully local** – never exported |
| ✅ Write-Back Mechanism | **Expert-controlled**, **optional**, **anonymized** |
| ✅ AI Model & Micro-Model Integration | **Pluggable**, **self-trainable**, or **use alliance-provided models** |
| ✅ Governance | **Decentralized**, **regionally co-governed** |
| ✅ Black-Box Risk | **None** – structure fully open and defined |
| ✅ Governance & Certification Transparency | **All alliance governance, certification criteria, licensing terms, and institutional rules are fully transparent and publicly accessible** |
| ✅ Preferential Access for Developing Nations | **The alliance provides tailored preferential policies, including fee reductions and support mechanisms, for developing and small sovereign states** |

If you are a government body, platform vendor, or independent developer, **SCSM is not a product—it’s a structural blueprint for future-proof, standardized security investigation.**
