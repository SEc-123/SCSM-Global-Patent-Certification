# SCSM Q&A

## ‚ùì What is the essence of SCSM? Is it a bound product? Who controls the data sovereignty?

**Answer:**  
SCSM (Semantic Chain Security Model) is not a product. It is a **structural methodology** designed to address critical bottlenecks in modern cybersecurity investigations.

Its core value lies in:  
- Defining a **semantic-driven architecture** for next-generation security investigation ("Investigation Layer")
- Supporting modular, structured, and interoperable SOC platforms
- Providing a universal certification standard **without vendor, platform, or cloud dependency**

**Deployment Flexibility:**  
- Fully **open-source compatible**
- Can be **locally developed** by any country or organization
- **Data remains fully local**, and sovereignty stays with the deployer
- **AI Model & Micro-models are pluggable and interoperable.**  
  Organizations may either independently train their own AI Model & micro-models and integrate them into certified SOC platforms, or optionally adopt pre-trained models provided by the AI-SIA Alliance.

## ‚ùì Do you use the ‚Äúknowledge write-back‚Äù mechanism to extract internal intelligence?

**Answer:**  
No. The "Knowledge Write-Back Mechanism" is part of AI-SIA Alliance governance. It operates **under structural controller authorization** and is available only to certified governments, enterprises, and organizations.

**Key Features:**  
- **Membership in the AI-SIA Alliance is a prerequisite for certified use of the SCSM structure, as the structure is protected by system and method patents.**  
  When a government or organization adopts an SCSM-compliant platform (product-level or system-level), and generates structured security investigation reports, it is ‚Äî by definition ‚Äî applying the patented system and method.  

  Therefore, obtaining **organizational-level certification** serves two key purposes:  
  - It **grants legal authorization** to use the SCSM structural method within certified implementations.  
  - It **formally confirms the organization‚Äôs capability** to conduct standardized, structured security investigations in accordance with the framework.  

  **Membership in the AI-SIA Alliance does not imply an obligation to contribute data or participate in knowledge sharing.**  
  Mechanisms such as **knowledge write-back** and **micro-model collaboration** are **fully optional**, and governed by local policy and expert discretion.  

  The alliance governance model ensures full **respect for data sovereignty**, **local autonomy**, and **non-intrusive certification boundaries**.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Led by the Expert Committee, composed of technical and compliance representatives from East Asia, North America, South America / Australia / New Zealand, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Gulf Region, Africa, and Southeast Asia ‚Äî not governed by any individual.
- **Expert-Driven**: Write-back actions are conducted by **human experts**, not AI, and there‚Äôs **no obligation**
- **Data Anonymization Required**: Only anonymized semantic knowledge can be written back‚Äîno raw or sensitive data involved
- **No intelligence value in raw form**: Only behavior patterns, not sensitive data, are shareable

This is not a surveillance system; it is a **global cooperative knowledge model**.

## ‚ùì Once deployed, can we still make autonomous decisions? Is there a forced platform?

**Answer:**  
Absolutely.

SCSM only certifies the **structure**, not the product. Certification verifies whether the system meets the structural standards for semantic investigation. It **does not mandate specific vendors**.

- You may **use third-party platforms or self-develop**
- **Deployment is fully under your control**
- You may switch platforms; only **structure re-certification** is required
- **No additional license fees** during the valid authorization period

Think of SCSM as a **framework standard**, not a binding product.

## ‚ùì Is AI-SIA a governmental alliance or an industry alliance?

**Neither.**

AI-SIA (Alliance for Investigative Security and Interoperable Architecture) is a **hybrid multi-stakeholder alliance governed jointly by a Structural Controller and a globally representative Expert Committee**.

It is not a treaty-based intergovernmental organization, nor a purely commercial consortium. Instead, it represents a **new form of decentralized governance and international technical cooperation** centered around semantic-driven security investigation.

## üèõ Governance Structure and Membership

| Stakeholder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Structural Controller** | Maintains structural and semantic integrity of the SCSM architecture. Does not participate in governance or commercial decisions. Acts as the **guardian of definition and legal consistency**. |
| **Expert Committee** | The Alliance‚Äôs highest governance body, composed of **technical and compliance representatives** from eight global regions: East Asia, North America, South America / Australia / New Zealand, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Gulf Region, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Fully responsible for governance, voting, technical evolution, and structural oversight. |
| **Sovereign National Members** | In addition to regional representatives, any country may join as a ‚Äúspecial member‚Äù to access structural standards and contribute to collective intelligence. |
| **Initial Enterprise Members** | A limited number of cybersecurity and cloud vendors who, upon completing node- or platform-level certification, become **initial technical members** with rights to propose and co-design future technical interfaces and standards. |
| **Observer Members** | Any certified enterprises may participate as an observer member ‚Äî eligible to access certified interfaces and collaborate without governance authority. |
| **Standards Organization Seats** | International or national standards bodies may assign official observers to participate in governance discussions and structural roadmap decisions to ensure compatibility and transparency. |

---

## ‚úÖ Membership & Certification Framework

All members must undergo **structural certification and authorized use licensing** in accordance with their role.

| Member Type | Certification & Authorization Requirements |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Governmental Organizations** | Must obtain **Organization-Level Certification**. Licensing may be **annual** or **one-time**, with no entry barrier. Governments may also build their own platforms and apply for platform-level certification. Non-commercial use is eligible for one-time structural authorization. |
| **Platform-Level Products** | Whether government- or enterprise-built, any platform must pass Platform-Level Certification. Non-commercial platforms may request one-time licensing; commercial platforms follow annual licensing. |
| **Initial Enterprise Members (Limited Seats)** | Cybersecurity or cloud vendors that complete Node/Platform-Level Certification and occupy limited seats gain the right to participate in **interface evolution, technical roadmap discussions, and proposal submission**. |
| **Other Enterprise Vendors** | May obtain certification and integrate into the ecosystem via defined interfaces, but without governance participation. Certification criteria remain identical. |

## üéØ Purpose and Strategic Vision

AI-SIA is **not a control mechanism**, nor a monitoring system. Its objectives are:

- üß† To **maintain semantic consistency and structured knowledge** in the global cybersecurity industry  
- üîÑ To **facilitate interoperable behavior chains** and cross-organizational intelligence flow  
- üìê To **transition the industry from reactive rule-based security to semantic investigation**  
- üåç To **build a decentralized, evolvable, and transparent framework for cooperative knowledge retention**

---

## üîí SCSM Structural Certification Is a Prerequisite

Participation in AI-SIA requires formal authorization to use the patented SCSM structure:

- Members must complete Organization / Platform / Node-Level Certification  
- Authorization may be **annual or one-time**, depending on use case  
- Members agree to uphold core principles of structural integrity, interface consistency, and data sovereignty
